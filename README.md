# NLP-Fake-News-Detection
This Python script showcases the preprocessing steps for text data intended for fake news detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It encompasses tasks such as data loading, cleaning, stemming, and Bag of Words (BOW) representation using CountVectorizer. The code demonstrates techniques to transform raw text into numerical features, enabling further analysis and machine learning model development for fake news classification. It leverages libraries like pandas, seaborn, nltk, and scikit-learn to process and prepare textual data effectively.
